# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Hermes plugin tools `perplexity_ask` and `perplexity_research` backed by the standalone CLI, with compact TOON results, source/connector catalog, recency and persistent-chat options, and `/perplexity-config` for user-selected search models.

### Fixed

- Node test module mocks now use `namedExports`, restoring the full test suite on Node 22.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- File attachments for `perplexity_search` and the standalone CLI via repeatable `--attach` flags.
- Positional CLI queries with `--recency` and `--limit` options.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Session continuation (extension)** — `perplexity_search` accepts a `thread` param (a session id from a previous result's Meta section, or a `perplexity.ai/search/<id>` URL) or `continue: true` to keep the same Perplexity conversation across calls. Session state (slug, read-write token, last backend uuid) is persisted locally with a TTL matching the server-side lifetime of incognito chats.
- **Cookie-jar credentials (extension)** — the extension now works from session cookies, not just the Bearer token: OTP login captures the full `Set-Cookie` jar, and `~/.config/pplx-cli/auth.json` written by `pplx login` is used as a read-only fallback when the extension has no stored token.
- **Live model catalog in `/perplexity-config`** — the model picker now lists models fetched from `GET /rest/models/config?config_schema=v1` instead of a hardcoded list, with a fallback to the bundled slugs when offline.
- **`scripts/login.ts`** — interactive email-OTP login helper for the extension.
- **`pplx` CLI: temporary chats by default** — new chats run incognito with a local session registry, TTL expiry guards and an auto-sweep; `pplx ask --continue` resumes the most recent registry session. Covered by opt-in e2e tests.
- **`pplx ask --save <file>`** — dump the reply to a file.
- **`pplx ask --image` / `--save-images`** — image-mode asks extract generated images; `--save-images` downloads them (fetching only the parsed, allowlisted URL object).
- **`pplx models --picker`** — list only the models the webapp UI offers (the `config` slots), plus `--all` and `--mode <m>` filters and `--json` output; live catalog via `GET /rest/models/config?config_schema=v1` (supersedes the earlier "no endpoint" contract §H) with a 24h disk cache and bundled-slug fallback offline. `--model` shell completion offers the live slugs too. The endpoint carries no availability/deprecation field — retired models vanish from the list server-side.
- **`pplx login` overhaul** — browser-like User-Agent replay and one-by-one credential paste.
- **Nix packaging** — `package.nix` builds the `pplx` CLI and installs the agent skill under `share/pplx/skills`; the CLI version is derived from `cli/package.json`.

### Fixed

- **`pplx ask` tty garbling** — `onEvent` stopped the spinner on every SSE event and `spinner.stop()` unconditionally emitted its clear sequence (`\r` + spaces + `\r`), erasing the first ~20 columns of the already-streamed answer on a shared terminal; the next suffix write then overwrote from column 0, producing the observed repeated clears, inline reprints, and a visually truncated answer. `stop()` is now idempotent (writes the clear only when a spinner is actually visible) and `onEvent` stops the spinner once.

### Changed

- Docs corrected: `research/api-contract.md` §H, `research/network/API-INDEX.md`, `cli/README.md`, `cli/skills/perplexity-cli/SKILL.md`.
- Repository hygiene for public releases: captured identifiers, tokens, signatures and URLs in test fixtures were replaced with synthetic values (fixture structure and coverage unchanged); generated agent artifacts and machine-local tool config are no longer tracked, and `cli/package.json` now ships an explicit `files` allowlist.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Sonnet 5 Thinking, and GLM-5.2 are available as supported Perplexity models.

### Changed

- Searches now always run with `is_incognito: true`. The `incognito` tool parameter, `PI_PERPLEXITY_INCOGNITO` env var, config file field, and `/perplexity-config` incognito prompt were removed; `/perplexity-config` now sets the default model only.
- Prefer Perplexity's `user_selected_model` field to the inconsistent `display_model` field when reporting the model used.

### CI

- Update `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to v7.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Migrated to the renamed pi packages: `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, and `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (formerly `@mariozechner/*`). Peer dependencies now require the `@earendil-works` scope, and `@sinclair/typebox` is no longer a peer dependency (`Type` comes from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`).

### Fixed

- `PI_PERPLEXITY_COOKIE` / `PI_PERPLEXITY_COOKIES` now accept a bare `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` value, matching what `/perplexity-login --browser` accepts.

### CI

- Restrict npm publishing to tags whose commit is already on `main`.
- Disable checkout credential persistence and pin actions to commit SHAs.
- Add Dependabot configuration for npm and GitHub Actions dependencies.

### Documentation

- Add `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting instructions.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Browser credential paste now runs exclusively through `/perplexity-login --browser`; `authenticate()` no longer prompts inline on Cloudflare challenges.
- URL deduplication of sources now lowercases only the scheme and host, keeping case-sensitive paths and queries distinct.

### Fixed

- Stop clearing the cached auth token automatically when Perplexity rejects authentication (transient 401/403); use `/perplexity-login --force` to re-auth explicitly.
- Import `randomUUID` from `node:crypto` instead of relying on the global WebCrypto object, restoring the documented Node 18.14.1 support.
- Report `sourceCount` consistently with the rendered source list when `limit` is fractional or out of range.

### CI

- Run typecheck and tests on push/PR and before npm publish.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Browser cookie login fallback: paste a Copy-as-cURL command or Cookie header via `/perplexity-login` when desktop/OTP auth is unavailable.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- Removed the Bun runtime dependency; Perplexity requests now use pi's Node runtime and development uses npm scripts.

### Fixed

- Require reliable `Set-Cookie` access for email OTP auth instead of silently dropping auth cookies on unsupported Node fetch runtimes.
- Cancel the Perplexity search response stream after terminal SSE events to avoid leaving fetch bodies open.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Route email OTP authentication requests through the Bun-backed Perplexity fetch path to avoid CSRF 403 failures under Node/jiti.
- Send browser-like auth headers and include response previews in OTP HTTP errors.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Model selection is now controlled by `/perplexity-config` or `PI_PERPLEXITY_MODEL` instead of an LLM-facing tool parameter.
- Updated the configured model list with current Perplexity internal model slugs.

### Added

- Opt-in live E2E test for validating Perplexity model selection.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **`/perplexity-config` command** — Interactive configuration for default model and incognito mode, stored at `~/.config/pi-perplexity/config.json`
- **Model selection** — New `model` parameter on `perplexity_search` tool to choose Perplexity backend model (Sonar, GPT-5.4, Claude 4.6 Sonnet Thinking, Gemini 3.1 Pro, Deep Research, etc.)
- **Incognito toggle** — New `incognito` parameter to control whether searches appear in Perplexity web history
- **Config priority chain** — Per-call params → env vars (`PI_PERPLEXITY_MODEL`, `PI_PERPLEXITY_INCOGNITO`) → config file → defaults
- **Config display in TUI** — Render components now show model and incognito status

### Changed

- Auto-clear cached token on auth rejection instead of requiring manual `/perplexity-login --force`

### Fixed

- Restore error rendering and safe error handling in search client
- Apply config defaults to Perplexity UI settings
- Simplify current model label in config
- Isolate tests from `mock.module` cache pollution

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- `pi-extension` keyword for pi package discovery

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Strip v prefix in version check
- Simplify README description

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
